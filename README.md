# rpi_sunflower_light_switch

RPi Sunflower Light Switch v0.0.2

Raspbian + Python + GPIO

With this program you will inform RaspberryPi of your geolocation, and it will automatically determine the exact moment of twilight and dawn at your location, then switching the lights. You will no longer need to install a photoelectric relay on the roof or install a timer that needs frequent adjustments.
